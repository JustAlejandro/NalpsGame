Narrator: Since the beginning of time, humans and Nalps have lived amongst each other, working together to better mankind's quality of life. Each year, citizens in the city of Splamfle celebrate the sucessful relationship between Nalp and Nalp Trainer at the Annual Nalp Trainer Festival. This year is going to be particularly memorable for a certain Nalp Trainer. See that guy over there? That’s Jarek. He comes from the village, Beese. He is very plain looking, almost completely broke, not the sharpest tool in the shed-
~
Jarek: I can hear you, you know.
~
Narrator: Really? Oh. Well it’s rude to eavesdrop into other people’s conversations. Mind your business. 
~
Jarek: Jeez, alright then. 
~
Narrator: As I was saying, Jarek is going to compete in the Grandest Competition, where trainers from all around the world compete to get into the Elite 5. The winner of the competition will get the title of Da Most Bestest Nalp Trainer. Now, Jarek and his Nalp just entered the city by bus. They still have yet to learn that public transportation isn’t reliable or timely.
~
Jarek: What do you mean?
~
Announcer: Sign-ups for the Grandest Competition close in 4 minutes!
~
Jarek: Oh, fr*ck! We have to go! they leave
~
Narrator: Hey, you on the other side of the screen! I have to tell you something important, but you can’t tell Jarek or his Nalp. Today is the day they face great tragedy. You should try your best not to make things worse. Alright, we should join back up with them before they get suspicious. You have to promise we keep this secret to ourselves, okay?
